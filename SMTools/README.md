This product includes the SMTools v1.5.7 software framework developed by Sven Maerivoet.
The framework was designed for the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 1.8.0 or higher.

The JStandardGUIApplication class provides a standard Swing based GUI framework.
Typically, this JStandardGUIApplication is subclassed, with several methods overridden. These methods control the application's settings, the visual layout of its GUI, and the actions that need to be taken upon user input.
Consult the javadocs for a more extensive overview of the framework.
